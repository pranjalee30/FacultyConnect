                    <h2 className="about__subtitle">How It Works</h2>
                    <p className="about__text"><strong>Faculty & Professors:</strong> Faculty members can easily register and create their profiles on CampusLocator. Once registered, they can set their daily and weekly timetables, specifying where they will be at different times throughout the day. This ensures that their availability and location are always up-to-date and accessible to students.</p>
                    <p className="about__text"><strong>Students:</strong> Students can log in to CampusLocator to view the real-time locations and schedules of their professors and faculty members. No more wandering around the campus or waiting outside officesâ€”find your professors instantly and plan your visits accordingly.</p>

                    <h2 className="about__subtitle">Inspiration</h2>
                    <p className="about__text">The idea for CampusLocator was born out of a personal experience. While searching for a professor on a sprawling campus, it became clear that there had to be a better way to find and connect with faculty members. Thus, CampusLocator was created to address this very need, making it easier for students to reach out to their professors when they need them the most.</p>

                <div className="about__section">
                    <h2 className="about__subtitle">Future Goals</h2>
                    <p className="about__text">Currently, CampusLocator is designed for NIT Agartala, providing our college community with an efficient way to connect. However, we have big plans for the future. Our vision is to expand CampusLocator to every college, allowing faculty members to register themselves with their respective college names. This will enable students from various institutions to find their professors by selecting their college, making CampusLocator a universal platform for academic connectivity.</p>
                    <p className="about__text">We are committed to continuously improving and expanding our services to ensure that CampusLocator becomes an indispensable tool for students and faculty members across all campuses.</p>
